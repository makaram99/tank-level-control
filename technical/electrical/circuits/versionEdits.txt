Version 2:
	Control Circuit:
		1. Edit GPIOs pin headeres' Letters.
		2. Remove residual diode on relay interface.
		3. Use dip-switches instead of jumpers for peripherals power closer to main power leads and use indication LEDs.
	
	Power Circuit:
		1. Edit footprint of LM317 for easy soldering.
		2. Reverse voltage signs and o/p connector.
		3. Increase Border area to avoid screw' holes distortion.
		4. Add pin header for far access to Latch button.
		5. Add pin header for dfar access for fuse.
		6. Buy components first to modify overlay.
