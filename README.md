## üîë Introduction

Tank Level Control System is a system designed to monitor and control the level of a fluid in a tank.

If the tank gets empty and filled periodically such as in **Residential Buildings** as shown in the image below.
It will be a boring task to get a human to monitor the tank. Also, human problems such as quick response is always slower than automation system. So, the automation system is the best solution for this problem.

</p>

It has many applications such:

1. Process tank: An important function.
2. Hot water tank: Water is removed, perhaps for washing down, and the level needs to be restored ready for the next wash cycle.

## üßÆ Block Diagram

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/liquid-level-control-system.png" alt="System Construction" width="500"/>
</p>

The main components of the system are:

1. **Fluid tank**: Used to hold the desired amount of fluid.
2. **Measurement system**: Senses the level of the fluid inside the tank.
3. **Controller**: Used to maintain the desired level by starting and stopping the pump depending on the information from the measurement system.
4. **Pump**: Feeds water from the source to the tank when actuated by the controller.

## ‚ûó Calculations of Distance

With the ultrasonic sensor, it sends ultrasonic waves which get beack to the sensor when hitting any surface (e.g., liquid in our case). The distance between the sensor and the surface is calculated by the following formula:

We can calculate the distance between the sensor and the surface as follows:

1. Calculate the time consumed from the instanse of sending the waves to the instance of recieving it using a timer inside the microcontroller.
2. As long as the ultrasonic waves are in fact sound waves. So, the speed of ultrasonic waves equals the speed of sound = **343 m/s**.
3. The distance between the sensor and the surface is:
   ```Distance = Speed * (Time / 2)```

4. Why the distance is divided by 2?
   The distance is divided by 2 because the waves go to the surface, then back to the sensor. So, the time calculated is the time it takes to go from the sensor to the surface and back to the sensor, hence the time must be divided by 2.

## ‚öô Working

### Code

To develop the project (code), you need to:

- YOU MUST HAVE **(MikroC Pro) or (Visual Studio Code with XC8 PIC Compiler)** installed on your computer.
- Open the [code](software/code) directory.
- If you have:
  - MikroC Pro: Click twice on **[tankLevel.mcppi](tankLevel.mcppi)** file. It will open with Mikro C Pro.
  - Visual Studio Code with XC8 compiler: Open the project with VS Code.
- Enjoy the development.
- To build the project, if you have:
  - MikroC Pro: Click on **Build button** on quick access bar of MikroC Pro, or press **Ctrl + F9** on the keyboard.
  - Visual Studio Code with XC8 compiler:
    - Open the terminal inside VS Code by pressing on **Ctrl + `** on the keyboard.
    - Type the command ```make all```. It will compile the project.
    - The hex file will be generated in the [code](software/code) directory with the name **app.hex**.
    - To flash the hex file to the PIC, type the command ```make flash```.
    - To remove the output files (hex and intermediate files), type the command ```make clean```.

**NOTE**: I've documented the code as much as I can. So, I hope you will understand the code.

### Simulation

To simulate the project, you need to:

- YOU MUST HAVE **Proteus** installed on your computer.
- Proteus has **compatibility issues** with its version, and the project may not be opened if you have a different version of proteus. So, you need to install **Proteus 8.9** to be able to simulate the project.
- From the [simulation](electrical/simulation) directory, open the folder of any of the boards.
- Click twice on the file ends with **[.pdsprj](simulation/simulation.pdsprj)**.
- It will open with Proteus as shown here:
  - Control Circuit
   <img src="electrical/docs/test_simulation/simulation_control_circuit.gif" alt="simulation_control_circuit"/>
  - Power Circuit
   <img src="electrical/docs/test_simulation/simulation_power_circuit.gif" alt="simulation_power_circuit"/>

- As shown in the Control Circuit, it is divided into blocks such as Controller, PUMP, and Sensor blocks.

- To run simulation, click on **F12** from the keyboard.
- Increase/Decrease the distance measured by the ultrasoni sensor by pressing Up/Down arrow on the Sensor block. The distance measured by the sensor will be displayed on the LCD screen as a percentage representing the level percentage of the tank. The percentage depends on a predetermined value equals to the height of the tank (in our case, the tank is 24cm height).
- When the percentage is lower than 15%, the pump will be turned on.
- When the percentage is higher than 80%, the pump will be turned off.
- When the percentage is between 15% and 80%, the pump will be latched to the last state. If the pump was on, it will be remains on. If the pump is off, it will remains off.
- To stop the simulation: Press twice on **ESC** key from the keyboard.

**NOTE**: The keypad is not used in the current version of the project. It is put for future use.

## üéØ Results

After running the project either on the simulation (Proteus) or running the physical hardware. The result was as expected. So, you also can use the project and it will work as expected.

You can check the working of the project by opening the [test_project.m4v](electrical/docs/test_videos/test_project.m4v) file.

If you want to check operation of each circuit, open:

- [test_power_circuit.m4v](electrical/docs/test_videos/test_power_circuit.m4v) to see the working of power circuit.
- [test_kit.m4v](electrical/docs/test_videos/test_kit.m4v) to see the working of control circuit.
- [test_short_circuit.m4v](electrical/docs/test_videos/test_short_circuit.m4v) to see the working of short circuit protection.
